There is a rectangular N x M grid of square cells. Each cell is either a unit of land or a unit of water. Two cells are adjacent if they share a side. Two adjacent land cells are said to be part of the same island. The size of an island is the number of land cells that form that island. 
Given the N X M grid, you are required to find the total number of islands and the size of the largest island. 
Input

The first line contains two integers N and M(1<=N,M<=1000), separated by a space. The next N lines contain M characters each. Each of these M characters is either a '.' or a 'x', representing a water cell and a land cell respectively.
Output

The output contains two integers separated by a space. The first integer is the number of islands and the second integer is the size of the largest island.
Example

Input:
4 5
xx..x
xxxx.
..xx.
xx...

Output:
3 8

Explanation: 
In the grid below, cells marked with the same number are part of the same island. The island that is marked with the integer 1 has a size of 8.
